# mono-example-kngmkr
Example of what can be done with Unity/mono games, using C#.

## What's here:
- Add money: simplest example of getting a player (in this game) and making a call
- List/set achievements
- Buttons, textboxes, in-game debug info
- Initial object loader: to be called from your injector

## What's not here:
- An injector: if you're here, you should already have a working injector

## Why this game
- Pathfinder: Kingmaker fits the classic Game->Character->Player(s)->Inventory->Item model that most pepople, who are getting into game research, are taught.
- There are easier ways to 'hack' this game...just edit your saves; this speaks to my intent (to be educational) in sharing code I don't own.
